- This is a terrible good idea
- Yes I'm making a blogging platform in the shape of an OS file directory
- Yes I'm tweaking after spending so much time working on VertexDB while learning everything about Nextjs, Backend and all its related technologies
- No I don't care, ooga booga monke

## TASK LIST

- [x] Update to latest Nextjs, react etc canaries
- [x] Deploy to vercel
- [x] Scaffold basic layout
- [x] Desktop layout.tsx
- [x] Documents folder (page or component) as explorer window
- [x] Within, blog folders navigates the explorer window to that blog
- [x] Figure out how to minimize "use client" impact of making file explorer draggable
- [x] Make file explorer draggable on blue header area
- [x] Constrain draggable elements to inner window
- [x] Work on maximize button - maximized window shouldn't be draggable
- [x] Create text file component
- [x] Move signup process to a component within taskbar start menu instead of page
- [x] Set up database (Vercel PostgreSQL w/ Drizzle ORM)
- [x] Complain on Github about months-long multi-project schema drizzle bug that tries to kill your DB with a sequence drop
- [x] Complain on Github about another driizzle bug where .default(false) & .default(sql`FALSE`) don't work on boolean()
- [ ] Wait until Drizzle makes use of their funding and unfucks these major fuckups
- [x] Password hashing with Argon2, NIST guideline requirements
- [x] Sign in, sign out
- [x] Enter password twice prompt, crosscheck on FE & BE
- [x] Ensure you communicate that leading and trailing spaces aren't allowed in password (html pattern="^[^ ].+[^ ]$")
- [x] So validate that part on FE first, then on BE in case they bypass it on purpose
- [x] Finish setting up auth (Lucia)
- [x] Put auth in start menu
- [x] Close start menu when clicking outside of it
- [x] Button icons for close/maximize/not-maximize
- [x] Text file components should render as draggable window
- [x] Fix my piece of shit I key by desoldering page down and putting it in I's place
- [x] Come up with empty folder, filled folder and notepad icons (shortcut and window header icons)
- [x] Initial position & size of file explorer on first render
- [x] Completely disable highlighting outside of notepad text
- [x] Look at mobile not being able to use the native resize control - yeah that doesn't work on mobile shame I might still support dragging on mobile though
- [x] Maybe add local clock in task bar? Could be dope if you use website on f11
- [x] Create zindex context for window focus order on click
- [x] Consider windows in task bar // NO since we opted out of doing minimization
- [x] Check address bar not scaling down past 390px viewport width (I forgot I wanted min-width on windows I'm a clown)
- [x] Use blog title for url slug and address slug (done, use encodeuricomponent and decodeuricomponent, don't really like what it looks like in browser URL bar though)
- [x] Think about supporting window dragging on touch devices
- [x] Create blog + server action
- [x] Create post + server action
- [x] Modify create post server action to only include title, then make new action triggered by SAVING a txt file
- [x] Set up blog & post ordering
- [x] Consolidate control buttons menu style stuff classes w/e with notepad too, also wrap notepad file btn in span and make that relative instead of entire bar
- [x] Move blog and post creation into File button akin to how I have post saving set up
- [x] Back button doesn't have the hover thing fix it clown
- [x] Eliminate race conditions (spamming post submit creates multiple posts) - disable on pending, if user fucks with disabled... I mean enjoy the ratelimit and duplicate post titles - I do allow that. Dupe blog obv not an issue here since I do checks in backend.
- [x] Keep track of state, if notepad file has been dirtied (modified) prompt a confirmation when they try to exit saying that the modifications haven't been saved yet. Onchange re-dirty the state, on save clean the state.
- [x] Enable show password on creation and login (NIST)
- [x] Set up toast for warning, success and confirmation windows
- [x] Fix click gap between icon and text
- [x] Autoroute user to newly created blog
- [x] Icon view style functionality/context (Setting carries over in all folders)
- [x] Put in the actual filepath in the save warning dialog
- [x] ATTEMPT TO ROLL MY OWN RATELIMIT FROM SCRATCH, GOT ROUGH IDEA OF HOW IT CAN WORK
- [x] Consider separate ratelimiting for action types (Signup/Signin, Data fetching, Data mutation (Blog/Post))
- [ ] Established that filecount being rendered, and not container height, can affect file explorer window dragging performance at scale.
- [ ] Therefore, try to implement some form of virtual scrolling - I do not want pagination, "load more", or "infinite scrolling" effects that renders things on action. I WANT the scrollbar to remain the same size and position at all times, as if it were aware of the total space taken by all the files, despite them not being rendered outside view. This becomes complicated once you consider the fact that intended height isn't static, since width can be resized and icons flow down.
- [ ] Consider granular control for ratelimiting in instances where guest users share corporate networks (Introduce IP)
- [ ] Look into making file creation input infinitely vertically-expanding so user can see what they've entered at all times
- [ ] Use the isDirty prompting thing if user tries to navigate away from page
- [ ] Look into duplicated re-renders on save, exit, onchange etc notepad
- [ ] Look into date locale mismatching between server and user client
- [ ] Create a shortcut for a dxdiag type thing that lists info about the site
- [ ] Delete post/blog + server actions
- [ ] Make sure deletion also uses dialog prompts/confirm/error
- [ ] Set up blog & post search filtering
- [ ] Analytics (Posthog?)
- [ ] Sentry mayhaps?
- [ ] position fixed bottom stuff has been broken on firefox mobile for years, look into it because that breaks taskbar when zoom + drag
- [ ] Some form of pagination for blogs and maybe posts, dragging performance sucks once there are a lot of files in the div
- [ ] Metadata, especially important for blog links
